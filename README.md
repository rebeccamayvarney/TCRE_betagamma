The repository provides scripts and documentation for calculating beta_land and gamma_land from ESM data (cLand and tas).

<code>CMIP6_betagamma.ipynb</code> calculates beta_land and gamma_land for CMIP6 models and compares the results to Arora et al. (2020). This includes two additional models that were not yet included in previous analyses.
