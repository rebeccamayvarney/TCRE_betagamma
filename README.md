The repository provides scripts and documentation for calculating beta_land and gamma_land from ESM data (cLand and tas).

<code>CMIP6_betagamma.ipynb</code> calculates beta_land and gamma_land for CMIP6 models and compares the results to Arora et al. (2020). This includes two additional models that were not yet included in previous analyses.

<code>TCREsource_betagamma.ipynb</code> extends this calculation to all modeling data sources available (e.g., additional single model process ensembles).

<code>Bayes_betagamma_land.ipynb</code> applies a Bayesian framework to estimate beta and gamma updated with information from all available sources.
